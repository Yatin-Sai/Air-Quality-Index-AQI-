MONITORING STATIONS:
Air quality monitoring stations are essential tools for understanding and managing air pollution in urban and rural environments, in order to obtain real-time insights into the levels and sources of air pollution, as well as how they change throughout the day and year.
By combining high-precision sensing, robust data management, and real-time communication, they serve as the main centres for assessment.

AIR QUALITY INDEX:
It is a numerical scale used to report and forecast daily air quality, making complex air pollution data understandable for the public and helping people make informed health decisions. AQI values run from 0 to 500, with higher values indicating greater air pollution and increased health risks
